# Twich Chat Overlayer FireFox WebExtension

Works in Firefox 47+, and will (soon) also work as a Chrome extension, out of the box.

## TODO
- Change Chat position
- BTTV fix
- custom width

### Version 0.1.1
+ Added Toggle Button
+ Added Feedback Link (please tell me which Features you are missing)
- Fixed chat flickering
- Fixed not being able to go in theatre mode without chat overlay

If you are missing a feature please let me know and I'll try my best to implement it.
